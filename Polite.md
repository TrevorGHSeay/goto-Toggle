## The Polite Framework - Open Source Project

Polite is a Lexing, Parsing, Runtime, and Compiler framework designed for easy creation and execution of new dynamic .NET scripting languages. It includes all the necessary API to get starting creating your own language using the TDOP (top-down operator precedence) methodology. This includes all context-free grammars and, additionally, most other grammars if you manage your static denotation methods correctly.
