## The Alder Method

In the spirit of accessibility, The Alder Method uses its own (new) intermediary natural programming language as input API for to produce the effect of a broad range of programmatical assertions and performance.

Using The Alder Method, one can simply write basic sentences, in what's called 'Plain English', to have it perform functionality as though you programmed it at the language level. This baby boasts 3D vector coordination at a whim, spherical and linear interpolation at a glance and the ability to change necessary properties with a sentence and no more.

This not only saves users time but money, hassle and the sense of dependence one can feel from relying on a fellow professional for something they themselves consider too easy to be bothered with.
