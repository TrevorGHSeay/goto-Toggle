## Cosmos Master - A Universe Within Worlds

In development for more than a year and a half, with myself being the only stack developer, producer, writer, and QA analyst on the team, Cosmos Master is an MMO-RCE-RPG game that's free to play for anybody. Cosmos Master is hosted by the [Second LifeÂ®](https://secondlife.com) virtual reality simulator engine, with the aim to permit players to not only play for free, but make money doing it at a reasonable, consistent rate. 

Use your BX-Z 42 to gather resources from their deposits; refining, using, selling, and buying them; fight, level up, upgrade talents, pick sides and make real money.

While Cosmos Master is still under development - with adding content, the community evolving, new mechanics being added - it demonstrates a firm conviction against Pay to Win mechanics, striving (and succeeding) in bringing this goal to life.

Thank you all for those who have gotten us this far.
