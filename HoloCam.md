## HoloCam - A 3D Camera for All

The HoloCam and HoloScreen, when combined, provide a way for Second LifeÂ® users to render a 3D representation of a static environment. It tracks the movement of up to 10 agents within 20 meters of the HoloCams surroundings, allowing the owner to check in on valuable locations from afar.

This method can be invaluable to those who need to know who is in an area, and exactly where at any given time.
