##Tutorials

Below are a list of sequencial jumpstarter explanations I've put together to give anyone just learning a better insight about what code is, what it can do, how to use it and why. Each one is detailed in the order I believe will help the most people for the learning process of cognitively associating one's self with the mind of the machine (from a software perspective).

Thanks for showing interest!
